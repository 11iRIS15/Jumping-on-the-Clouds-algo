# Jumping-on-the-Clouds-algo
This function calculates the minimum number of jumps needed to reach the last cloud, moving only on clouds labeled 0 and avoiding clouds labeled 1. It always tries to jump two clouds ahead if possible; otherwise, it jumps one cloud, counting each jump until it reaches the end.
